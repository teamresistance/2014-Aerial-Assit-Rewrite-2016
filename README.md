### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository.
2. Use **Import from GitHub** in IntelliJ IDEA to clone your fork.
3. Let it simmer (it'll index and download dependencies).
4. That's it. :rocket:

### Dependencies

The WPILib is pulled directly from the [official FIRST repository](http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/maven/release/). The other dependencies are bundled under the /libs directory. Be sure to run a Gradle Sync to resolve new dependencies.
