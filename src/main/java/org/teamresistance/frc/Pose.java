/**
 * A superstructure that represents the entire physical state of the robot at the given tick, such
 * as its current heading and relative position. It helps ensure all operations within the same tick
 * operate on the same sensor readings: we would propagate the current tick's {@link Pose} rather
 * than the sensor objects directly.
 * <p>
 * A new {@link Pose} with the latest sensor readings should be created on every tick/update. The
 * looper is responsible for passing the {@link Pose} to its dependent {@link Looping} subsystems
 * (and anything else that requires the {@link Pose}).
 * <p>
 * This plays nicely with the {@link Controller}s by preserving their purity as functions whose
 * outputs are solely defined by their inputs, thus enabling their composition. For higher-level
 * {@link Command}s, it may be preferable to simply propagate the sensor objects directly.
